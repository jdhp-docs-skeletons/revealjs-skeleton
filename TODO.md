# TODO

## Skeleton

* [ ] Put CSS in a dedicated file
* [x] Split content/main.md
* [ ] Make the French branch
* [ ] Write the PDF target in the Makefile (use https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape ?)
* [ ] Check if it works well offline
* [x] Use gitsubmodule to get the latest version of RevealJS
* [x] Use gitsubmodule for figs/logos
* [ ] Make a snippets document in a dedicated git repository
* [ ] Add a hint about navigation usage on the title page
    * [ ] Make an animated instruction on the title page so that users understand it's not a static HTML page but an interactive document
* [ ] Improve SEO ?
    * [ ] Add HTML meta tags: author/subject/keywords/...
    * [ ] Before the document is published on JDHP, convert MD to HTML (with data-markdown https://gist.github.com/1343518 or marked https://github.com/chjj/marked as described in https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown)
* [ ] Use main.html or index.html ?
* [ ] Thought about figs/logos: it is copied for each document in www.jdhp.org/docs/ (waste of space)
