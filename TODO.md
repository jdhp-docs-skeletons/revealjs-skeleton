# TODO

## Skeleton

- [ ] Add a makefile in "figs/" to make/clean figures from scripts (Python,
      ...)
- [ ] Improve the init_skeleton.sh script (add safety checks: are the variable
      defined ? is the skeleton branch already exist ? ...)
- [ ] Put CSS in a dedicated file (in "style/html/" like the rst-skeleton)
- [x] Split content/main.md
- [ ] Make the French branch
- [ ] Write the PDF target in the Makefile (use https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape ?)
- [ ] Check if it works well offline
- [x] Use gitsubmodule to get the latest version of RevealJS
- [x] Use gitsubmodule for figs/logos
- [ ] Make a snippets document in a dedicated git repository
- [ ] Add a hint about navigation usage on the title page
    - Make an animated instruction on the title page so that users
      understand it's not a static HTML page but an interactive document
- [ ] Improve SEO ?
    - [ ] Add HTML meta tags: author/subject/keywords/...
    - [ ] Before the document is published on JDHP, convert MD to HTML (with
          data-markdown https://gist.github.com/1343518 or marked
          https://github.com/chjj/marked as described in
          https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown) to make content
          reachable by search engines ?
- [ ] Use main.html or index.html ?
- [ ] Thought about figs/logos: it is copied for each document in
      www.jdhp.org/docs/ (waste of space)
- [ ] Find a solution to avoid "reveal.js/" redundancy in "www.jdhp.org/docs/"
- [ ] Make a clean bibliography (like bibtex) from .bib files ?
- [ ] Is the HTML document compliant with mobile devices (see Google's
      advices) ?
